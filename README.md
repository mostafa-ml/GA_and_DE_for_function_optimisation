# Genetic Algorithms and Differential Evolution for Function Optimization  

## Classwork Project for Evolutionary Algorithms Course (Grade: A+)  

This project explores the implementation and comparison of **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** and **Differential Evolution (DE)** for optimizing various benchmark functions. It emphasizes the design and customization of evolutionary operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation.  

### Key Features  
- **Customizable Optimization**: Users can experiment with different parameter settings for GA and DE.  
- **Intuitive GUI**: Provides an interactive interface to visualize algorithm performance and optimization results.  
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Includes side-by-side performance evaluation of GA and DE on diverse optimization problems.  

This project showcases the practical application of evolutionary algorithms in solving optimization tasks, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation.
