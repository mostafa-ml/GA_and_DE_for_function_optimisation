# Genetic Algorithms and Differential Evolution for Function Optimization.

## Classwork project for Evolutionary Algorithms acedmic course (Grade A+)

Implemented and compared `Genetic Algorithms` and `Differential Evolution` for optimizing a variety of benchmark functions. The project involved designing selection, crossover, and mutation techniques, allowing users to interactively optimize functions and visualize algorithm performance through an intuitive GUI.
